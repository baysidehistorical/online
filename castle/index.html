            <p style="padding: 50px 0px;">While most of the original wooden Civil War era buildings and barracks were already constructed by the time the engineers arrived at Willet's Point, several new buildings were added. these included a photography laboratory, munitions storage, a brick fireproof torpedo storehouse, and a mess hall known as the Casino.</p>

            <p><i>Left Photo</i><br>The Officers' Club was built using ballon-frame construction. Employed throughout the 19th century, the technique allowed for rapid construction since balloon framing did not require the use of large timbers.</p>

          <div class="ib-content-full">
            <p style="padding: 50px 0px;">It was more than a decade after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers School of Application was established at the fort that the Officers' Club was built in 1887. Funds for the construction of a new Officers' Club were requested in 1885 by LTC Henry Abbot, Commander of the Engineer Battalion at Willet's Point. the new building was meant to replace the much smaller Casino mess hall. Abbot's total request for the operation of the post that year came to $19,000. Of this, the largest budgeted item was $12,000 for the construction of the Offices' Club.<br>Architectural plans for the three-story wood frame building were drawn by the Office of the Quartermaster General in the Castellated Gothic Revival style. The Castle features octagonal pavilions that flank a central pavilion and the building was originally painted a grayish white to simulate stone.</p>

          <div class="ib-content-full">
            <p style="padding: 50px 0px;">That the architectural design of the building pays direct tribute to the Engineers' castle insignia is a reflection of their intended permanency on the fort. However, the Army Engineers only used the Officers' Club for fifteen years. The Corps of Engineers and School of Application left Fort Totten in 1902, and moved their personnel and materials to the Washington Barracks (now Fort McNair) in the District of Columbia.</p>
