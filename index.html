      <p style="text-align:left">The Bayside Day festival which took place September 26, 1914 was sponsored by local business owners, the Bayside Civic Association, elected officials, and residents. As part of the Bayside Day commemorations, BHS has invited community members to photograph current Bayside business owners at their work place. When the exhibition is over, the photographs will become part of the BHS archival collection. <br>While we recognize this show is by no means complete, and only captures a small portion of the diverse businesses in Bayside, it was our intent to engage the community by creating an opportunity to become a part of history. Preserving the past is only part of BHS's goal; documenting the present for future generations completes the mission. </p>
