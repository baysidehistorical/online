      <p style="text-align:left">The Bayside Day festival which took place September 26, 1914 was sponsored by local business owners, the Bayside Civic Association, elected officials, and residents. As part of the Bayside Day commemorations, BHS has invited community members to photograph current Bayside business owners at their work place. When the exhibition is over, the photographs will become part of the BHS archival collection. <br>While we recognize this show is by no means complete, and only captures a small portion of the diverse businesses in Bayside, it was our intent to engage the community by creating an opportunity to become a part of history. Preserving the past is only part of BHS's goal; documenting the present for future generations completes the mission. </p>

      <p style="text-align:left">The Bayside Historical Society is pleased to annouce our inaugural online exhibition featuring early 20th Century post cards of Bayside from our archival collection. Information for the descriptions of the post cards were culled from various sources including, but not limited to, our archival repository, early newspaper articles, the Fort Totten Historic District Designation Report of 1999 as well as online resources including www.nyc.gov for information regarding our parks. We hope you take the time to explore Bayside through these post cards and discover the many wonderful places that existed, and in several instances, still exist today.</p>

      <p style="text-align:left">James John "Gentleman Jim" Corbett (September 1, 1866 – February 18, 1933) was an American professional boxer and a former World Heavyweight Champion, best known as the man who defeated the great John L. Sullivan. Despite a career spanning only 24 bouts, Corbett faced the best competition his era had to offer; squaring off with a total of nine fighters who would later be enshrined alongside himself in the International Boxing Hall of Fame.</p>
